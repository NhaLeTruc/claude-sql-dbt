    description: >
      Customer analytics mart with RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and lifetime value metrics.
      Enables customer behavior analysis, segmentation, and targeted marketing.
      Grain: One row per customer.

      Business Logic:
      - Lifetime value = sum of completed order totals (excludes cancelled/returned)
      - Recency = days since last order
      - Frequency = total number of orders
      - RFM score = combined 1-5 scale score (5 is best)
      - Segmentation based on RFM thresholds
