# Specification Quality Checklist: E-Commerce Analytics dbt Demo

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-08
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

**Content Quality Assessment**:
- ✅ Specification describes WHAT and WHY without HOW implementation details
- ✅ Focus on analytics outcomes (customer insights, product performance, time-series trends, marketing ROI) rather than technical mechanisms
- ✅ All mandatory sections present and complete (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Data Quality Requirements)

**Requirement Completeness Assessment**:
- ✅ Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all ambiguities resolved through reasonable assumptions documented in Assumptions section
- ✅ All 28 functional requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria use measurable metrics (100% documentation, 0 test failures, <5 min build time, <2 sec query time, >80% test coverage)
- ✅ Success criteria avoid technology specifics (e.g., "analysts can answer business questions" not "Postgres queries run fast")
- ✅ Four user stories with complete acceptance scenarios (given/when/then format)
- ✅ Six edge cases identified with documented handling approaches
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded to e-commerce analytics demo with mock data
- ✅ Eight assumptions explicitly documented (B2C context, USD only, 2-3 year span, DuckDB/SQLite target, etc.)

**Feature Readiness Assessment**:
- ✅ All 28 functional requirements map to acceptance criteria through user story scenarios
- ✅ Four prioritized user stories (P1-P4) cover primary analytical workflows (customer analytics, product performance, time-series, marketing attribution)
- ✅ 15 success criteria provide comprehensive measurable outcomes across completeness, quality, performance, usability, and demonstration value
- ✅ Specification maintains technology-agnostic approach while providing sufficient detail for planning

**Overall Status**: ✅ APPROVED - Specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)

**Strengths**:
1. Comprehensive coverage of dbt features aligned with constitution requirements
2. Clear prioritization enabling incremental MVP delivery (P1 = customer analytics foundation)
3. Extensive data quality requirements with specific test coverage definitions
4. Measurable success criteria supporting validation at completion
5. Well-defined entities providing clear dimensional model structure

**No issues found** - specification passes all quality gates.
